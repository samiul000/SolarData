## Introduction
SolarData is a Webapp based on NASA API, Python and Streamlit library. It uses NASA API to fetch data from nasa weather database and shows monthly total solar power and average monthly sun hours based the latitude and longitude of a place according the year user wanted.

### Work Method 
Just provide latitude, longitude of a place using any website as you like and set the year you want the data from. The webapp will fetch data for you in table and bar chart style.

### Run Locally
Step - 1 : Clone the repository on your machine.
``https://github.com/samiul000/SolarData.git``

Step - 2 : Extract the folder.

Step - 3 : Open the terminal or command palette and navigate to the folder location

Step - 4 : Run
``streamlit run main.py``

This will run the webapp on your browser in localhost.
Note : You have to have a your own NASA Api to run it locally.
